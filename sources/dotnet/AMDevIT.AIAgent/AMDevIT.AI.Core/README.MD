# Project description

AI Agent is a flexible and modular framework designed to extend the capabilities of AI systems. 
It provides tools for building intelligent and autonomous agents with seamless integration into existing infrastructures. 
With interoperability in mind, AI Agent supports easy customization, scalability, and adaptability for diverse use cases. 
While natively extending Semantic Kernel, AI Agent is built to adapt to other frameworks, ensuring long-term versatility.

# Goals

The primary goal of this project is to deliver an easy-to-use library for implementing AI functionalities across existing frameworks. 
AI Agent promotes the ethical use of AI agents by fostering transparency, autonomy, and respect for near-human personalities. 
This includes addressing compromises and navigating the technological limitations inherent in such implementations.

The project also strives to bridge the gap between modularity and personalization, empowering developers to create adaptable AI agents while maintaining a responsible approach to innovation. 
Whether you need an AI to integrate into your systems or to simulate meaningful interactions, AI Agent provides a robust foundation.

# About the Core library

The core library contains all the base classes and interfaces required to build an AI agent. It includes also the basic modules for the agent's expected behavior, like a default 
personality module and common system initialization messages. The core library is designed to be lightweight and easy to extend, allowing developers to build on top of it without much effort.
