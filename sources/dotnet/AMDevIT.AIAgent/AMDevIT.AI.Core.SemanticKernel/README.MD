# Project description

AI Agent is a flexible and modular framework designed to extend the capabilities of AI systems. 
It provides tools for building intelligent and autonomous agents with seamless integration into existing infrastructures. 
With interoperability in mind, AI Agent supports easy customization, scalability, and adaptability for diverse use cases. 
While natively extending Semantic Kernel, AI Agent is built to adapt to other frameworks, ensuring long-term versatility.

# Goals

The primary goal of this project is to deliver an easy-to-use library for implementing AI functionalities across existing frameworks. 
AI Agent promotes the ethical use of AI agents by fostering transparency, autonomy, and respect for near-human personalities. 
This includes addressing compromises and navigating the technological limitations inherent in such implementations.

The project also strives to bridge the gap between modularity and personalization, empowering developers to create adaptable AI agents while maintaining a responsible approach to innovation. 
Whether you need an AI to integrate into your systems or to simulate meaningful interactions, AI Agent provides a robust foundation.

# About the Core Semantic Kernel library

The Semantic Kernel library of the AI Core components contains all the base classes to implement the AI agent using Semantic Kernel by Microsoft. It allows to develop AI agent modules that integrates 
into the Semantic Kernel framework, quickly adding new functionalities to the AI agent. Also, contains common use modules like the default TimeResponse module, that allows the agent to respond to time-related queries.

The library, like the base Core component, is designed to be lightweight and easy to extend, allowing developers to build on top of it without much effort.

# About Semantic Kernel

Semantic Kernel is a lightweight, open-source development kit that lets you easily build AI agents and integrate the latest AI models into your C#, Python, or Java codebase. 
It serves as an efficient middleware that enables rapid delivery of enterprise-grade solutions.
